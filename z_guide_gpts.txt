Food trucks:
- If I were to create a guide post like the hiking one you helped me with for food trucks in chattanooga, what attributes should I include?
- Can you generate that document again but include these food trucks? Please include any details you are aware of or can find through search for each 
- do I need to fact check it or are you confident with what you've generateds accuracy?
- generate a title for social meida
- for the html you generated, regenerate it. Only use Cuisine Type, Location and Schedule, Menu Highlights, Price Range, and contact information attributes. Also use this HTML template as an example

Matt asked, Can you go over the process you use to create the 10 ultimate guides you mentioned to sit on your site that get natural links etc? I’m in the cycling niche and would love to see how you approach this.

Matt is referring to my suggestion that you start your site by writing 10 absolutely killer, content-filled, authoritative, and beautiful guides that thoroughly cover the “core” of your niche.

For example, I did that on my own site with The Complete Guide To Building A Profitable Website.

There are several reasons I believe in this approach:

You become a better expert just by writing them.
It sends a great signal to Google if your initial articles are masterpieces.
They can constantly be referenced in future articles.
The guides will spark so many stand-alone ideas (make notes of them as you go).
Above all, it sets the tone – both inside yourself and on your site – for the future.
