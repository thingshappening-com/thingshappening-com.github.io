"It's dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you're feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them. I was so preposterously serious in those days, such a humorless little prig."

"Lightly, lightly – it's the best advice ever given me... So throw away your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. That’s why you must walk so lightly."

Better to get your dopamine from improving your product than from an expected result

Every time you are overwhelmed, see no point, want to give up and keep going you pass two people who gave up where you persisted 

You want a less stressful job? So does everyone, its hard to get to. Put in the large amount of unrewarded hours to get there

Life doesn't give many people easy mode. Keep in mind you mostly knew what you had to do for coding and were motivated by the progress you made and were working 5-10 hours every day. For this project im in constant guess and check mode where the furrher i commit to a project line : events, guides, bookshelf and see nothing on them, the more it stings and i dont know what to do. This is going to take a while and youll need breaks to lick your wounds, take your time and keep going lightly

Take breaks to lick your wounds if shit goes really bad again or youre losing yourself completely 7-20 days is usually good

You only need to figure it out once and youll be good to go for these types of projects

If you put thought and energy and a couple rewrites into a few guides. And then aggregate events for 15 vendors. You can then have people paying you for sponsorships. That's pretty awesome

Mark Twain: "The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one"

Every two hour session I put in is a vote to being closer to 
the life I want more than anything, ultimate time freedom by working for myself

Internal:
- freedom to travel with my parents on extended trips
- be able to go on any trip with my family without hesitating
- pay for my family on vacation 
- Live longer, less stress
- get to be a better friend
- get to do MTB races and get in better shape
- A huge fuck you to Teri Garza, Christine Cooper and Hareem. Use the pain
- You are actually helping your community and small businesses. It's from a selfish foundation like Adam Smith first noted but it's still an attempt to have positive value for society
- Buy a VT camp for cash

External:
- James clear interview for a half an hour, any is fine, but Tim Ferriss is great
- Scott Delong - https://x.com/scottintheworld/status/1745549448737104030
- 2 hours of deep work every day no matter what. https://x.com/thepatwalls/status/1761459095746314700
  -  Do this after you hit 400k of investments and $20k cash OR $1-2k revenue per month.
  - this makes sense for this project because there's so much you can iterate on. New web content ideas, newsletter ideas, facebook ideas, audience acquisition, business operations
  - But I'll never miss a week, because it's really hard to fail at something you're consistent at. - Niche Site Lady

HORMOZI AND WILLIAMSON TALK:
Shift from “this is hard to no-one will be able to do this” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewMJdf32zWA 

Protect your passion at all costs 

This is the hardest part. Everything else is downhill.  

Expecting it to be easy makes it much harder than it needs to be 

You’re looking around to see who can help you and you’re like f*ck it’s me, again

When youre on the start path you can’t look at the outcome as the only positive because you will never make it. Most positive frame is thinking about what you’re becoming as the asset that you are building. Whenever I finished a long days work I was becoming more like the type of person who could work for five years without reward. Some of the biggest reinforcements I’ve had has been future casting the story that I would tell about the shitty period I was in 

I screenshotted my bank account because I told myself “this won’t fucking happen again”. Having a larger narrative of where you’re ultimately going gives yo
