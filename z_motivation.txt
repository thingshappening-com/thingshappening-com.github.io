I can now accomplish more on a project like TH in 45 min than 97.5% people can in a week. Work like it. 
Given my advanced tech skills, my AI usage, my progress on the website so far, past projects like TTT, my ability to keep going, my documents for reference on functionality and gpt prompts.

Every two hour session I put in is a vote to being closer to 
the life I want more than anything, ultimate time freedom by working for myself

Internal:
- freedom to travel with my parents on extended trips
- be able to go on any trip with my family without hesitating
- pay for my family on vacation 
- Live longer, less stress
- get to be a better friend
- get to do MTB races and get in better shape
- A huge fuck you to Teri Garza, Christine Cooper and Hareem. Use the pain
- You are actually helping your community and small businesses. It's from a selfish foundation like Adam Smith first noted but it's still an attempt to have positive value for society
- Buy a VT camp for cash

  -  Do this after you hit 400k of investments and $20k cash OR $1-2k revenue per month.
  - this makes sense for this project because there's so much you can iterate on. New web content ideas, newsletter ideas, facebook ideas, audience acquisition, business operations
  - But I'll never miss a week, because it's really hard to fail at something you're consistent at. - Niche Site Lady

You’re looking around to see who can help you and you’re like f*ck it’s me, again

When youre on the start path you can’t look at the outcome as the only positive because you will never make it. Most positive frame is thinking about what you’re becoming as the asset that you are building. Whenever I finished a long days work I was becoming more like the type of person who could work for five years without reward.
