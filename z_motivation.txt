Every two hour session I put in is a vote to being closer to 
the life I want more than anything, ultimate time and stress freedom 

Internal:
- freedom to travel with my parents on extended trips
- be able to go on any trip with my family without hesitating
- pay for my family on vacation 
- Live longer, less stress
- get to be a better friend
- get to do MTB races and get in better shape
- A huge fuck you to Teri Garza, Christine Cooper and Hareem. Use the pain
- You are actually helping your community and small businesses. It's from a selfish foundation like Adam Smith first noted but it's still an attempt to have positive value for society
- Buy a VT camp for cash

External:
- James clear interview for a half an hour, any is fine, but Tim Ferriss is great
- Scott Delong - https://x.com/scottintheworld/status/1745549448737104030
- 2 hours of deep work every day no matter what. Do this after you hit 400k of investments and $20k cash OR $1-2k revenue per month.
  - this makes sense for this project because there's so much you can iterate on. New web content ideas, newsletter ideas, facebook ideas, audience acquisition, business operations
  - But I'll never miss a week, because it's really hard to fail at something you're consistent at. - Niche Site Lady
