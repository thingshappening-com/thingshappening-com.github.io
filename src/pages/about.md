      I created this website because I thought there might be a need for an even simpler way to find  things to do locally than what's already published to the web. Plus I didn't want to have to login to social media every time to find  things. I had some ideas and put them to task. What came out was a local guides library to find  events and places of interest, then and group notable acitivies from the area. I popped in some discovery features like search and tagging and was happy with the result. Now I'm sharing it with you. I hope you find it helpful.
