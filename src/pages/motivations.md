      I created this website because I thought there might be a need for an even simpler way to find out about things going on than what's already published to the interweb. Plus I didn't want to have to login to social media every time to find out about things. I had some ideas and put them to task. What came out was a event calendar and local guides library to find out about events and group notable acitivies from the area. I popped in some discovery features like search and tagging and was happy with the result. Now I'm sharing it with you. I hope you find it helpful.
