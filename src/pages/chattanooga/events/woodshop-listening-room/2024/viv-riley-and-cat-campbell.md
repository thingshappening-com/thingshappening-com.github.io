On May 5th come out to see Viv & Riley + Cat Campbell:

"Viv & Riley's sound is old-soul roots music to its core, elegantly combining a traditional backbone with the fresh iconic melodies of future-leaning indie-folk, and the tightly wound vocal harmonies of the old-time and classic country music they came from." 

"Catherine Campbell is a soft spoken singer/songwriter and indie rock practitioner with a writerly focus on pulling the listener into a romantic world a little apart from hard reality. Her songs are described as dreamy ditties, romantic reflections, twilight ballads. Beautifully orchestrated with her notable nightingale voice in the middle." - The Band
