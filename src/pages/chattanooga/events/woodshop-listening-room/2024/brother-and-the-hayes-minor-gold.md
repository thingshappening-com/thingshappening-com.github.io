On May 24th come out to see Brother and The Hayes + Minor Gold:

"Brother and The Hayes is a Texas born, Tennessee based sibling duo heavily influenced by artists like Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris, and Doc Watson. Jennie Hayes and David have released four studio projects since the band was formed in 2017 and their fifth is in the works. You would be hard pressed to find a duo that writes more authentically and prolifically. The rapport between brother and sister is something to behold as they draw you in and make you feel like part of the family." - The band
