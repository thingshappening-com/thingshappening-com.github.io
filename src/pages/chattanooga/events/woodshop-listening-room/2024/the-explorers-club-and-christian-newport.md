On June 8th come out to see The Explorer's Club + Christian Newport:

"Originating from the coast of South Carolina in 2005, The Explorers Club are American pop rock at its best. They feature a rotating cast of musicians, led by singer songwriter and producer, Jason Brewer. Their music is heavily influenced by the vocal harmony styles and production of The Beach Boys, as well as classic rock and roll arrangements made popular by The Beatles, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, The Zombies, The Monkees and The Byrds." - The band
