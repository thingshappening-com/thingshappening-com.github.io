The journey through grief can often feel overwhelming, but no one needs to navigate it alone. The "Walking with Grief" workshop offers a space to understand and process loss in healing ways.

This interactive workshop is open to anyone grappling with any type of loss or grief. Led by Kate Caldwell of Awareness Arts Collective, LLC, it provides an in-depth look at the nature of grief and strategies for managing its emotional toll. Participants will engage in discussions, meditative practices, and creative exercises designed to support their grieving process. Each session is tailored to the participants' comfort levels, allowing them to choose how deeply to engage with the material.

In addition to fostering personal healing, the workshop offers tools for self-care and opportunities to connect with others facing similar challenges, creating a community of support.

Having founded Awareness Arts Collective, LLC, she aims to help clients alleviate suffering and enhance joy and fulfillment in their lives by promoting personal growth.
