Beekeeping is a hobby thatâ€™s gaining popularity for its benefits to the environment and personal wellness, not to mention the sweet bonus of harvesting your own honey! Crabtree Farms offers a workshop where Randall Kennedy, an experienced beekeeper with eight hives, demystifies the art of beekeeping. Participants will learn about bee biology, the necessary equipment, and the honey extraction process, including a live demonstration with an observation hive.

Everyone leaves with a sample of fresh honey, enriching their understanding of beekeeping. Children aged 10-16 can explore this fascinating hobby for free if accompanied by a paying adult.
