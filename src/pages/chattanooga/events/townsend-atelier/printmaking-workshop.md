3 day workshop. This class is a unique pairing of two very different, but very versatile printmaking techniques. The focus will be on collagraphy, making creative handmade print plates using found objects, and pochoir, handcrafting reusable stencils, for use in a variety of printmaking applications both on and off the press.
<br><br>
Collagraphy, is a printmaking process in which materials are glued or sealed to a rigid substrate to create handmade print plates. You will have the opportunity to experiment with a variety of found objects, repurposing numerous materials into infinitely-creative designs and motifs. The plates will then be printed on the press, via a wet-paper method, which helps to highlight the unique textures and values achieved via the varied materials of both low and high relief plates.
<br><br>
Pochoir is the French word for stencil. Stencils, in their most basic form as pigment-resisting materials, are one of the earliest known forms of printmaking and artmaking in general (think: prints of hands-on cave walls done with blown earth pigments). In the pre-digital days of illustration & design, stencils were used to achieve rich colors and patterns, and are still a viable means of art creation for many applications. In this class, we will delve into the creation of handmade stencils from a variety of materials, and learn unique ways to apply them to your art repertoire, both as a printmaking device and for use in and with other media.
