<br><br>
Every Monday for 4 weeks. Time to kick your paintings up a notch? This intermediate and advanced class is designed for students to work at their own pace. Receive individual instruction and discover your own unique style. Each session will begin with a brief review of one of the fundamentals of painting: using design in a composition, painting atmospheric and linear perspective, mixing colors, relating values, and anything the students would like to cover. See how to manipulate your source material to create the painting you want.
<br><br>
Please bring 2 or 3 paintings you would like to improve to the first class. You may also want to bring photographs to design and paint. I would prefer you bring your own photographs as opposed to those from magazines. Come and enjoy painting in a relaxed environment while you improve your skills and techniques in watercolor!
