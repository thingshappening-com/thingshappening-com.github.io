The summer season at Ross’s Landing is highlighted by the “Fourteen Saturdays of Summer” event, spanning every Saturday from Memorial Day through Labor Day. This free outdoor concert series showcases a lineup of the area’s most dynamic and impressive musical acts, providing an entertaining escape under the stars.

Guests are invited to bring their chairs and blankets, and pets on leashes are also welcome. For the best spots, arriving early is recommended. A variety of food and drinks will be available for purchase from local vendors at the venue.

The festivities begin with concession stands opening at 6:00 pm*, followed by live music performances from 7:00 pm until 10:00 pm each Saturday. This is an ideal opportunity for community members to enjoy the warm evenings filled with good music and great company.
