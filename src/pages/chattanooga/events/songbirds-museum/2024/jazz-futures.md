About The Artists:

The House band is a trio of local Chattanooga jazz players comprised of Adam Stone on guitar, Given Graber on bass, and Mike Salter on drums. These three have been playing together for a few years after meeting at various jazz jams, and playing in combos consistently. 

Dakari Kelly is a hometown hero of sorts. Being a classically trained bassist, over the last decade he has worked with names like Rick Rushing, Deacon Blues, & Kofi Mawuko of “Ogya World Music band.” He also tours nationally with hip hop artist BbyMutha as her DJ ! During his off season recently he has founded a new series called “Jazz Futures”—a unique approach to reviving the local jazz scene here in Chattanooga.
