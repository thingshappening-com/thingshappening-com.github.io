Fundraiser:
We are so grateful to have Steve Earle back at Songbirds, performing yet another solo acoustic show to raise money for our GUITARS FOR KIDS program. This will be an intimate, once-in-a-lifetime performance paired with delicious locally catered cuisine. For every $100 raised, we'll be able to buy a kid a guitar and provide them with 10 weeks of free lessons and music therapy. Your contribution allows us to share the joy of music with thousands of kids who would otherwise be without a music education..

Ticket Information:
Tickets for this exclusive event are very limited—only 75 tabled dinner seats. There will also be 25 show ONLY stools available that DO NOT INCLUDE DINNER. 

All dinner-and-a-show ticket holders will also receive a signed poster from Steve Earle.
