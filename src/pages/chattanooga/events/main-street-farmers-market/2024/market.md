This is a wonderful year round Chattanooga farmers market featuring 20+ [local vendors](https://www.mainstfarmersmarket.com/vendors). The event occurs every Wednesday year round. It's a great opportunity to get out of the house, buy health organic produce and support our local farmers and other vendors. Also noteworthy, there's free parking.
