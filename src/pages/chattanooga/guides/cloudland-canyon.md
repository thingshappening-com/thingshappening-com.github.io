      When it comes to exploring nearby parks it's easy to pick one that's closest to home. Whether that's Prentice Cooper, Stringers Ridge, or another park for you, we all have our defaults. But travel a bit further south (~20-25 miles depending) and you likely won't regret a trip to Cloundland Canyon State Park in Rising Fawn, Georgia. It was recently featured on The Discoverer as the <a href="https://www.thediscoverer.com/blog/the-best-state-park-in-each-state/XvHyVpKgiwAG5akA" target="_blank">best state park</a> in Georgia. After investigating a little further you'll quickly find out why. It has over 60 miles of trails ranging from easy to difficult with some of the best views you'll come across. In this guide let's take a look at more of what this nearby trail system treasure has to offer. For the <a href="#mtb-easy">MTB section</a> please note that if you do not own a mountain bike you can rent one

          This is a one mile out and back trail. Off this trail you can fish for catfish. You don't even need a license, if the Interpretive Center is open they have fishing poles you can use, free of charge. The pond is stocked with catfish, the catch and keep season runs from Labor Day - December. Closest parking for this trail is at the Park Disc Golf course.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this hike is an observation deck that offers a breathetaking view of the canyon vistas, be sure to stop and stare for a little while, maybe get a picture or maybe just store it in the old memory bank. In the summer there are blackberry bushes, with thousands of berries ripe for picking.

        The Overlook Trail isn't frequently noted in the hiking apps but it is a good trail to know about if the lengths of the others are intimidating. This trail is easy to access as it sits right in front of the parking lot linked parking lot. It's a short out and back trail with spectacular views of the park, especially in the spring and fall. It's a great way to get a taste for the park or to start venturing back out into nature if it has been a little while since your last hiking adventure.

        There's no direct Google location for this trail. I linked to the closest parking in the directions above. This paired with the <a href="https://gastateparks.org/sites/default/files/parks/pdf/trailmaps/CloudlandCanyon_TrailMap.pdf">trail</a> map should get you there. This is a trail loop to access primitive campsites and is also a nice 2 mile hike to explore a less frequently traveled, but still fairly easy hike. As with all of the other trails in the park remember to bring appropriate footware, something that can handle moisture and rocky terrain. Like the Meadowlands Trail the closest parking will be at the disc golf course.

          This route makes use of three trails, each short in lenth. 1. Bankhead (0.4mi), 2. Shale Flats (1.1m) and 3. Cloudland Canyon Connector (CCC) (~1.7mi). All of these trails are bidirectional. It should be a little over a 3-4 mile bike ride in total. Each trail is designated as easy. Shale Flats is a total climb of 53 feet and Bankhead's climb is 73ft, unknown climb on this section of CCC but expect between 100-200 feet. The ride will take about 20-30 minutes in total depending on your speed and skill level.
        <p>
        <p>
          You'll start out taking Bankhead a short ways before turning left onto CCC. Then you take CCC about another half of a mile before Shale Flats. Continue the entire 1.1 miles of Shale Flats before intersecting with CCC and Caprock, take CCC. Ride CCC back up to Bankhead and take Bankhead back to parking.

        Arguably the most popular trail in the 5 points system, take this trail out and back for close to a seven mile ride. You'll start by parking at the Ascalon Trailhead linked above and should be able to access CCC. The nice thing about this rise is it's a green the whole way and your main navigation note is to stay on the trail. CCC connects to many other trails in the 5 points network so you'll see a lot of forks, but just take CCC every time. The trail ends at Hinkie Road (RT 157). Then turn around and head back to Ascalon Trailhead where you parked.

          Nearly a 5 mile long loop style trail that keeps you on the outskirts of the canyon. As with any of the trails in this list make sure you wear proper footwear, it's pretty rugged. The trail features some beautiful views of the canyon as you take your lap around the park. This trail has in various years been rated one of the top hikes in the United States.

          This trail is accessed off of the West Rim loop. Although shorter in distance, it's noted as probably the most stenuous trail in the park. It's recommended not to take your dog, as there are over 600 grated metal stairs that can be painful on their paws. The difficulty of this hiking trail is rewarded by the waterfalls, along this path is both the Hemlock and Cherokee falls. The waterflow varies, but will be best after a rainstorm.

          This is a 6 mile out and back trail. It will guide you down into the valley of the canyon as it follows along various creeks. In the springtime the wildflowers add for an extraoridnary experience. It's a pretty difficult trail so be adequetely prepared mentally and physically. Neaby are Sitton and Case cave's, accessible by guided tour only, so if you want to make it an even more adventurous day, be sure to book a tour in advance.

          Park at 5 Points and begin riding north on Tailings Run, this is a 1.5 mile expert trail. Take Tailings to the Clouldland Canyon Connector (CCC) and ride the CCC (an easy trail) a few miles down until you get to the fork where a left turn will lead you onto the North Hogsback route. Note that once you get to 5 points, you're two thirds of the way through your ride on CCC. North Hogsback is another expert rated trail totaling 1.1 miles in distance. Take North Hogsback all the way to the 5 Points parking lot.

          Park at 5 Points and begin by taking Bankhead 0.4 miles to Clouldland Canyon Connector (CCC). Take a right on CCC until you get to the 5 Points intersection. At 5 Points find Kettle Bottom trail. Kettle Bottom is rated as an intermediate trail. You can either take it as a full loop or there is an alternate path that's slightly shorter (about 1/3 of a mile shorter). Both options take you back to 5 Points intersection where you'll take a right on CCC back to Bankhead and follow that back to the parking lot.

          Are you a disc golfer who's a sucker for scenery? The Cloudland Canyon State Park Disc Golf Course might be the course you're looking for. The course is easy to follow and well marked but some parts have been reported to be a little overgrown. The course has concrete tee's and though there are rest rooms in the state park, there are not restrooms readily available on the course. You have to pay the $5 entry fee to get into the park, but there's no additional fee after that. It's about a 5 minute drive from the park entrance to the course.

          Cloudland Canyon State Park offers pretty much every type of camping experience you have in mind. Want to camp out in a yurt? The have that. Want to bring your uncle Dave's RV? They have spots for that. Want to rent a cabin with friends? They can make that happen. You get the point. They also have primitive campsites for the folks who prefer the BYO tent lifestyle. There are additional fee's depending on what youre doing, make sure to check their website for rental and campsite availablility and registration. In the popular season's (we're looking and you spring and fall) you may need to book a few weeks in advance.

          The bad news? There is only one fishing spot in the campground. The good news? It's a pretty nice fishing spot. Cloudland Canyon has a pond that measure's about one acre. It's stocked with channel catfish which can be harvested from the day after labor day through the end of November. All other times are catch and release. If you don't have your fishing license, don't fret it's not needed for this location.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The easiest way to access the pond is via the <a href="#easier-hikes">Meadowlands Trail</a>, referenced above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Important note: There is no fishing allowed in any of the park creeks.
