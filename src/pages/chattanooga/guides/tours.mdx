      <div class="pb-5">
        Chattanooga was grounds for prominent civil war battles, with cemeteries of the time still operating. The Trail of Tears, which the city played a large role in, added another tragedy passage to its complex history. Hauntings and paranormal are still rumored to this day from murders and events that occurred generations ago.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-5">
        Those facts can only mean one thing, epic ghost tours. Okay maybe there's more than one conclusion to draw but you get the point. With this storied history comes some fun ghost tours etched in fact and folklore and one of the more popular businesses running these adventures is Chattanooga Ghost Tours.

      </div>
      <div class="pb-5">

        <div class="pb-2">2. UTC Cemetery Ghost Hunt (hunting equipment included). Are you really going to pass up an opportunity to ghost hunt? I hope you have a good reason. Otherwise take a 1.5 hour hunting tour around the UTC campus with a stop at the Citizens Cemetery (if ghost hunting was scary enough on its own).</div>
        <div class="pb-2">3. Walking Ghost Tour/Hunt Combo. A 1.5 hour combined tour for the best of both worlds if you couldn't choose just one.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-5"><b>Additional note</b>: They have a special Deluxe tour on Wednesday evenings where the tour stops at a couple of Chattanooga bars for virgin or alcoholic beverages.</div>
