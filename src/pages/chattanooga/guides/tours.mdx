        <div class="pb-2">2. UTC Cemetery Ghost Hunt (hunting equipment included). Are you really going to pass up an opportunity to ghost hunt? I hope you have a good reason. Otherwise take a 1.5 hour hunting tour around the UTC campus with a stop at the Citizens Cemetery (if ghost hunting was scary enough on its own).</div>
        <div class="pb-2">3. Walking Ghost Tour/Hunt Combo. A 1.5 hour combined tour for the best of both worlds if you couldn't choose just one.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="pb-5">
        Forget waterfront restaurant, take the water on the road with you as this historic paddlewheel riverboat leaves port traveling the Tennessee River for a scenic evening you won't soon forget.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-5">

      <div class="pb-5">

        If don't have a deep root phobia of this type of animal from 90's cinema (looking at you Batman), and are the adventurous type, this activity is probably going to knock your socks off.

      <div class="pb-5">
        The reviews speak loudly about what a fun experience this is, currently boasting a 5.0 star average on Google Reviews, it literally can't get better.
