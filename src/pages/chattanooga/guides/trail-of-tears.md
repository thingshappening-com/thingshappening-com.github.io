    The Trail of Tears is a tragic chapter in American history, particularly for the Cherokee Nation, and it has a significant connection to Chattanooga. This event was part of the broader Indian Removal Act of 1830, which aimed to forcibly relocate Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the southeastern United States to designated Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, in present-day Oklahoma.
