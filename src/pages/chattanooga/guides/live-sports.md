        <div class="pb-5">
          A historic and locally beloved AA professional baseball team in Chattanooga. Known by some baseball fans for the stunts ownership used to to draw in fans including having a pair of camels behind the right field fence during the 1996 season. History also tells us that in 1931 the New York Yankees played an exhibition game against the Lookouts during which a 17 year-old girl, Jackie Mitchell, pitched for the Lookouts and struck out MLB legends Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.
