      Did you know Chattanooga prides itself in its musical roots? Legendary blues singer Bessie Smith, aka the "Empress of the Blues",  called Chattanooga home as she and her six siblings literally raised themselves on street performances. She then went on to be arguably the most popular blues singer of the 1930's. For a taste of her music check out of her most popular songs, "Downhearted Blues", below.

      In exploring Chattanooga's musical history I've also come to learn of the Glenn Miller Orchestra. They're the group that popularized the song "Chattanooga Choo Choo" which was written for the musical film "Sun Valley Serenade" in 1941. The song went on to be nominated for an Oscar for best song that year and was such a standout success it was awarded the first ever Gold Record for selling 1.2 million copies.

      <span class="font-bold">Fun fact:</span> The Glenn Miller Orchestra still performs to this day. If you want to check out a live performance view their event schedule <a href="https://glennmillerorchestra.com/tour-schedule/" target="_blank">here</a>.
