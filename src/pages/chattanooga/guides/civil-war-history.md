       Chattanooga and it's surrounding areas are entrenteched with civil war history. The two primpary campaigns were the Battles of Chickamauga and the Chattanooga Campaign (composed of five separate but interconnected battles). The Battle of Chickamauga is on record as the second most deadly battle of the Civil War after the Battle of Gettysburg. The Union victory over in the Chattanooga Campaign marks a turning point in the civil war as Chattanooga was a major transportation hub referred to as the "Gateway to the Deep South". It gave the Union control of the supply lines and allowed troops to move effectively into the heart of the confederacy.

          Previously mentioned as the second most deadly battle during the american civil war. This battle was a major victory for the confederate army as the Union had been winning battles and advancing further south. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This battle was initiated by the Union forces under leadership of Major General William Rosecrans following his victory of the Tullahoma Campaign in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Confederate leadership was provided by General Braxton Bragg. During the attack a series of miscommunications by Union leadership opened a gap in their defensive lines which the confederate army exploited, causing the Union to retreat to Chattanooga (after significant casualities). This set the stage for the Chattanooga Campaign.

          <b>Battle of Wauhatchie<span class="text-customGreen1 text-xl2 font-bold">:</span></b> 
          This was the fist battle of the Chattanooga Campaign which took place on October 28th and 29th of 1963. The Union was victorious during this battle, a signficant victory as they had been struggling to feed and supply their troops and horses. This victory opened up transportation routes for much needed ammunition, food, and reinforcement troops. Before this confederate forces were able to stalk and raid Union supply wagons with views from atop Lookout Mountain.

          Occuring on November 23rd 1863 this was a relatively small but significant battle. After Union General was given information by confederate desserters that the confederates were falling back the General Thomas gave a recon order to observe and report back on confederate numbers. Following the recon Union soliders overtook Orchard Knob swiftly with limited casulaties on both sides. Orchard Knob became Grant and Thomas's headquaraters for the rest of the battles.

      This is a very pretty interesting house from the point of view of the family which resided as well as the war more generally. Robert Craven was an iron master, somewhat wealthy for his time, who originally built this six bedroom house for his family. As the war ensued it became a shelter for Confederate generals, while the militiamen would sleep in tents outside on the property. The Craven's stuck around with war encircling them for a period of time but following the Battle of Lookout Mountain, which in part took place on their property, they decided to leave. The Union forces used the house after the battle. Once the war ended the Craven's came back and Robert built the house again from scratch. What remains now is rebuilt home made to resemble the appearance of the house post war.
