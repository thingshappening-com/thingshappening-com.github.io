      <span class="font-bold">A Game at Barnes:</span><span> The small college atmosphere of a Scots basketball game can be a welcomed bit of novelty for those who haven't been to a Division 3 game before. It's high level basketball, on top of a mountain, at a great price; free for regular season games. I'm not so sure you'll be able to top that.</span>

          Chattanooga Lookouts
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          A historic and locally beloved AA professional baseball team in Chattanooga. Known by some baseball fans for the stunts ownership used to draw in fans including having a pair of camels behind the right field fence during the 1996 season. 
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          History also tells us that in 1931 the New York Yankees played an exhibition game against the Lookouts during which a 17 year-old girl, Jackie Mitchell, pitched for the Lookouts and struck out MLB legends Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. Store that fact for future trivia games. Games are played at AT&T Field.
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          The AA ballclub has featured a number of MLB stars throughout its history, recent notables include Joey Votto, Chris Sale, and Trevor Hoffman. Hall of Famers that have had stints with the program include Harmon Killebrew, Nolan Ryan, Satchel Paige, and Willie Stargell.

            If you've been to minor league baseball games before, chances are they weren't the most well attended and could get a little boring. You'll probably have a different experience at a Lookouts game. 
          </div>
          <div>
            The games are well attended and there's often a fun promo. Years past promos have been $0.25 hot dog nights, $2 drink specials, and fireworks fridays.

        We'd be remiss not to mention Boyd's Speedway, a dirt race track which closed after being purchased for land in 2023. Boyd's had been a local racing staple since 1952. Legend has it you can still hear the derby on warm Friday evenings in East Ridge in July, that's what I've heard anyway.
