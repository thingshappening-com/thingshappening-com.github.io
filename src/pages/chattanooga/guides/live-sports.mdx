      It's the top of the first inning, the Chattanooga Lookouts are taking on the New York Yankees in a 1931 exhibition game at Engel Stadium. 
      Leaving the batters box is George Herman "The Babe" Ruth, down on strikes. Strutting to the plate now is Henry Louis Gehrig, Lou for short.
      Our pitcher, takes in the moment but just for a moment, then quickly recalibrates as Lou has taken his position inside the four chalk lines.
      After a baseball duel of sorts, Lou also goes down on strikes, and our pitcher, a hero for a captured moment in time. This hero is non other than locally grown Jackie Mitchell.
      She, yes she, turned 17 years old weeks earlier. A born and raised Chattanoogan.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-5">
      Now imagine if you were around in 1931 and missed this momentous occasion? A chilling thought. We don't want that to happen for you, so we put together this guide to help you navigate the Chattanooga live sports menu.

          Chattanooga Lookouts
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          A historic and locally beloved AA professional baseball team in Chattanooga. Known by some baseball fans for the stunts ownership used to draw in fans including having a pair of camels behind the right field fence during the 1996 season. 
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          History also tells us that in 1931 the New York Yankees played an exhibition game against the Lookouts during which a 17 year-old girl, Jackie Mitchell, pitched for the Lookouts and struck out MLB legends Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. Store that fact for future trivia games. Games are played at AT&T Field.
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          The AA ballclub has featured a number of MLB stars throughout its history, recent notables include Joey Votto, Chris Sale, and Trevor Hoffman. Hall of Famers that have had stints with the program include Harmon Killebrew, Nolan Ryan, Satchel Paige, and Willie Stargell.

            If you've been to minor league baseball games before, chances are they weren't the most well attended and could get a little boring. You'll probably have a different experience at a Lookouts game. 
          </div>
          <div>
            The games are well attended and there's often a fun promo. Years past promos have been $0.25 hot dog nights, $2 drink specials, and fireworks fridays.

        We'd be remiss not to mention Boyd's Speedway, a dirt race track which closed after being purchased for land in 2023. Boyd's had been a local racing staple since 1952. Legend has it you can still hear the derby on warm Friday evenings in East Ridge in July, that's what I've heard anyway.
