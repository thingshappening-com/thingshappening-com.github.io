        Chattanooga and the surrounding area are deeply rooted in civil war history. The cities two largest and most storied events were the Battles of Chickamauga and the Chattanooga Campaign, five separate but related battles.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-5">
        The steep and rocky terrain of the region had a major influencer in both events, with thick forests difficult maneuver through and mountain ridges serving as premiere defense positions.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-5">
        Historic sites and battlefields exist today as national landmarks filled with history stations and larger exhibits. Some as a member of the National Parks Service, giving us the opportunity to walk the same ground where tens of thousands of soldiers (at the time the US population wad ~31 million) once fought for control of this country.
      </div>      
      <div class="pb-5">
        The Battle of Chickamauga is on record as the second most deadly battle of the Civil War after the Battle of Gettysburg. The Union victory here was a turning point in the civil war as Chattanooga was a major transportation hub referred to as the "Gateway to the South". It gave The Union control of the supply routes and allowed troops to move effectively into the heart of the confederacy.

          Previously mentioned as the second most deadly battle during the American Civil War. This battle was a major victory for the confederate army as the Union had been winning battles and advancing further south. 
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
          This battle was initiated by the Union forces under leadership of Major General William Rosecrans following his victory of the Tullahoma Campaign in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Confederate leadership was provided by General Braxton Bragg.
