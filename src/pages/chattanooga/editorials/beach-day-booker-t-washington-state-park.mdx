    I went to Booker T Washington State Park to find some water views. My dog Merlin came along, open to the idea.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    The turn into the park is easy to miss. Where you see the sign is where you turn. Parking is free.
  </p>

    From the recreation area, it's a short walk to the shoreline. I went in winter. Fewer people, fewer boats, more beach exposed from less rain. No bugs. Low humidity. Brisk air.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    The beach runs about a third of a mile, maybe a little more depending on water levels. Rocky throughout. No boulders, but the stones vary from marble-sized to baseball-sized in different sections. A surprising number of mussel and snail shells. Fewer skipping stones than I expected. Maybe it was a bad day for them. Maybe I need my eyes checked.
  </p>

    Dried driftwood lies along the bank, some pieces running from the shore into the water. Almost sculptural. One log made a natural bench. Easy to step over, though small children might need help.

    The forest is mostly deciduous with a few pines mixed in. Tall trees give shade unless you're there midday. Long views open across Chickamauga Lake, Appalachian hills on the horizon. I didn't bring binoculars. I wished I had.

    We shared the cove with mallards and coots. Vultures overhead. Birds of prey calling from the tree line. A kingfisher zipped through. The usual brush birds and small mammals moving around.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    Less boat traffic here than other parts of the lake, but stay aware. Good spot to fish the shoreline, launch a kayak, have a picnic with fold-out chairs. No swimming sign posted. Swim at your own risk. You can extend the visit on the 1.1-mile nature trail or the longer multi-use trails.

    It was clean. Keep it that way.

    There's no name for this stretch of beach. I'm calling it Merlin's Cove. It has some magic to it, and it's my dog's name. Call it what you want.
