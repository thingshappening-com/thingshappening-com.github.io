    I went to Booker T Washington State Park to find some water views. My dog Merlin came along, open to the idea.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    The turn into the park is easy to miss. Where you see the sign is where you turn. Parking is free.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    From the recreation area, it's a short walk to the shoreline. I went in winter. Fewer people, fewer boats, more beach exposed from less rain. No bugs. Low humidity. Brisk air.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    The beach runs about a third of a mile, maybe a little more depending on water levels. Rocky throughout. No boulders, but the stones vary from marble-sized to baseball-sized in different sections. A surprising number of mussel and snail shells. Fewer skipping stones than I expected. Maybe it was a bad day for them. Maybe I need my eyes checked.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    Dried driftwood lies along the bank, some pieces running from the shore into the water. Almost sculptural. One log made a natural bench. Easy to step over, though small children might need help.

    The forest is mostly deciduous with a few pines mixed in. Tall trees give shade unless you're there midday. Long views open across Chickamauga Lake, Appalachian hills on the horizon. I didn't bring binoculars. I wished I had.

    We shared the cove with mallards and coots. Vultures overhead. Birds of prey calling from the tree line. A kingfisher zipped through. The usual brush birds and small mammals moving around.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    Less boat traffic here than other parts of the lake, but stay aware. Good spot to fish the shoreline, launch a kayak, have a picnic with fold-out chairs. No swimming sign posted. Swim at your own risk. You can extend the visit on the 1.1-mile nature trail or the longer multi-use trails.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    It was clean. Keep it that way.
  </p>

  <p class="pb-5">
    There's no name for this stretch of beach. I'm calling it Merlin's Cove. It has some magic to it, and it's my dog's name. Call it what you want.
