If youâ€™re coming into elixir from a language like Javascript or Ruby you are familiar with ternary expressions and how to use them to simplify conditionals. In practice they look something like this:

```
const val = condition ? truthy_handler : falsy_handler
```

In elixir it is handled differently, the most common and frequently used way being:

```
if(condition, do: truthy_handler, else: falsy_handler)
```
