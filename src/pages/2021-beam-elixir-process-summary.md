Recently I took some time to try and get a better grasp on processes in Elixir. I attempted to distill that knowledge into 5 blog posts that you and I can revisit anytime to refresh our memory.

1) [BEAM/Elixir processes for web programmers](https://tinytechtuts.com/2021-beam-elixir-processes-explained/)

In this post I attempt to explain processes by defining prerequisite technical concepts needed to understand processes. From there I walk through `Process` concepts themselves, using examples where possible.

2) [BEAM/Elixir 'let it crash': what it does and does not mean](https://tinytechtuts.com/2021-let-it-crash-explained/)

Regularly I would come across the Elixir axiom "let it crash" and be uncertain of what was meant by it. Here I try to unpack that using examples of what it does and does not mean.

3) [Do BEAM/Elixir processes provide concurrency or enable parallelism?](https://tinytechtuts.com/2021-elixir-processes-concurrency-and-parallelism/)

The terms concurrency and parallelism are often confused for one other in discussion and I wanted to make sure I had a general understanding of the two so I wrote a brief post of what each means in relation to the BEAM ecosystem.

4) [An introduction to BEAM/Elixir processes in Phoenix](https://tinytechtuts.com/2021-introduction-to-elixir-processes-in-phoenix/)

I mostly program for the web and Phoenix is the web application framework for Elixir, therefore I wanted to have a general understanding of how processes worked within Phoenix. This post breaks down what I learned through an example web request.

5) [Elixir process module cheatsheet](https://tinytechtuts.com/2021-elixir-process-module-cheatsheet/)

This is a brief overview of some of the `Process` module functions and `Kernel` functions for working with processes.
