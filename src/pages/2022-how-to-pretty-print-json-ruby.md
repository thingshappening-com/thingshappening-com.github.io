The easiest way Iâ€™ve found to accomplish this is using `puts`

The call below will print the json object and return nil

```
puts data.to_json
{"admin":true,"email":"admin@gmail.com"}
```

If you need the object to be printed on a multi-line basis you can use the command line tool [jsonpp](https://github.com/jmhodges/jsonpp).

After installing you can copy an object like the one above and paste it into its own file and then run the command:

```
jsonpp path/to/file.json
```

Which will produce the following output:

```
{
  "admin": true,
  "email": "admin@gmail.com"
}%
```
