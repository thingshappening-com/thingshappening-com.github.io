Robert Craven was an iron master, somewhat wealthy for his time, who originally built this six bedroom house for his family. As the war ensued it became a shelter for Confederate generals, while the militiamen would sleep in tents outside on the property. The Craven's stuck around with war encircling them for a period of time but following the Battle of Lookout Mountain, which in part took place on their property, they decided to leave. The Union forces used the house after the battle. Once the war ended the Craven's came back and Robert built the house again from scratch.

It was recently featured on The Discoverer as the <a href=\"https://www.thediscoverer.com/blog/the-best-state-park-in-each-state/XvHyVpKgiwAG5akA\" target=\"_blank\">best state park</a> in Georgia. After investigating a little further you'll quickly find out why. It has over 60 miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails ranging from easy to difficult with some of the best views you could hope for. The park offers numerous activities suitable for the whole family, whether for a day trip or a weekend getaway. In this guide let's take a look at more of what this nearby trail system treasure has to offer.\n      <br><br>\n    </div>\n\n  <h4 class=\"pb-10\">\n    <a href=\"https://gastateparks.org/sites/default/files/parks/pdf/trailmaps/CloudlandCanyon_TrailMap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n      Trail Map pdf\n    </a>\n  </h4>\n\n  <section class=\"pb-3 text-xl2\" id=\"easier-hikes\">\n    <div class=\"pb-3\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-5xl\">Easier Hikes<span class=\"color-pink ml-1\"><b>.</b></span></h2>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"pb-3\" id=\"meadowlands-trail\">\n        <div class=\"text-3xl\"><span class=\"color-pink mr-2\"><b>1.</b></span>Meadowlands Trail</div>\n        <div><b>Distance:</b> 1 mile</div>\n        <div>\n          <b>\n            <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cloudland+Canyon+State+Park+Disc+Golf/@34.8266854,-85.4778982,18z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x8860489de9aa9e81:0xaa78f71a6429baa9!2sAscalon+Trailhead!8m2!3d34.8369616!4d-85.4386864!16s%2Fg%2F11cjhz867p!3m5!1s0x886048fe2437145d:0x70f3de2a12fbbef!8m2!3d34.8264344!4d-85.478418!16s%2Fg%2F11c6tys3_m?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">\n              Directions\n            </a>\n          </b>\n        </div>      \n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <p class=\"pb-3\">\n          This is a one mile out and back trail.

This is a trail loop to access primitive campsites and is also a nice 2 mile hike to explore a less frequently traveled, but still fairly easy hike. As with all of the other trails in the park remember to bring appropriate footwear, something that can handle moisture and rocky terrain. Like the Meadowlands Trail the closest parking will be at the disc golf course.\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n\n  <div class=\"flex flex-col justify-center items-center mb-16 mt-16\">\n    <img src=\"/images/chattanooga_guides/outdoors/cloudland/trail-shot.jpg\" class=\"responsive-box pb-1\" alt=\"West Rim and Overlook Trail fork\">\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <em>On the trail in CCSP</em>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <section class=\"pb-3 text-xl2\" id=\"mtb-easy\">\n    <div>\n      <h2 class=\"text-5xl\">Easier MTB Rides<span class=\"color-pink ml-1\"><b>.</b></span></h2>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pb-8\">\n      The easier MTB rides below are from the 5 Points Recreation Area.

Each trail is designated as easy. Shale Flats is a total climb of 53 feet and Bankhead's climb is 73ft, unknown climb on this section of CCC but expect between 100-200 feet.

You'll start by parking at the Ascalon Trailhead linked above and should be able to access CCC.

CCC connects to many other trails in the 5 points network so you'll see a lot of forks, but just take CCC every time. The trail ends at Hinkie Road (RT 157).
