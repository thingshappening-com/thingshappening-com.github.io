The union was victorious during this battle, a signficant victory as they had been struggling to feed and supply their troops and horses. This victory opened up transportation routes for much needed ammunition, food, and reinforcement troops.

Robert Craven was an iron master, somewhat wealthy for his time, who originally built this six bedroom house for his family. As the war ensued it became a shelter for Confederate generals, while the militiamen would sleep in tents outside on the property. The Craven's stuck around with war encircling them for a period of time but following the Battle of Lookout Mountain, which in part took place on their property, they decided to leave. The Union forces used the house after the battle. Once the war ended the Craven's came back and Robert built the house again from scratch.
