It is the sacrifices, strategies and sheer determination that made up two opposing armies fighting for control of such a vital gateway to what came to define America forever.Quite simply it helped win the war.\n    <br><br>\n    From the imposing ridgeline of Missionary Ridge, where Union forces overcame a surprising and dramatic Confederate assault, to the contemplative Tower at Orchard Knob (where General Ulysses S. Grant planned his campaign) each site is an evocative reminder of those fateful days around Chattanooga well more than 150 years ago. The Battle of Brown's Ferry, although clouded by more famous battles that occurred during the same time frame is very important as it marked a key point in breaking the Confederate siege on Chattanooga and establishing control over \"Wauhatchie\", aka the all-important ‘Cracker Line’, which would keep vital supplies flowing to sustain clear victory for Federal forces here through this part of 1863.\n    <br><br>\n    In this guide, you'll be offered a guided walking tour of these historic places — not just where they are and what to expect when you get there, but the stories contained within them as well. Wether or not you are walking the same ground where generals planned their next move, or standing where ordinary soldiers performed extraordinary feats of arms these places bring to life the Civil War in almost a way only experienced by those who have had this experience. This is a must-see tour for any student of the Civil War, allowing one to explore America as it lived during and just after this flashpoint conflict.\n</div>\n\n\n <div class=\"pb-3 text-2xl\">\n    <div>\n      <h2><span class=\"color-pink\">1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park</h2>\n    </div>\n    <div>Where: Chickamauga Battlefield Visitor Center, 3370 LaFayette Road, Fort Oglethorpe</div>\n    <br>\n    <div>\n      The oldest and largest military park in the United States, the Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park is dedicated to two major battles from the Civil War.\n    </div>\n    <br>\n    <div>\n      The Battle of Chickamauga was fought in September 1863, and led to one of the biggest Confederate victories but also contributed to Union success during its Chattanooga Campaign.

This natural positioning was a great benefit for the Union army, which would be able to shell Lookout Mountain via artillery during \"The Battle Above The Clouds\" on November 24th. Several weeks later, Union forces including Wilder's men captured Chattanooga from the Confederates in a campaign that was crucial to driving the Rebel army back south and out of Tennessee due its important position at railroads and supply lines.\n    </div>\n    <br>\n    <div>\n      But in an age before highways and railroads, the river offered a vital route for carrying supplies to soldiers fighting on other parts of the war's battlegrounds.

After taking success at Lookout Mountain and Orchard Knob, the Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant attacked the fortified positions well entrenched on ridges held in numbers for great effect of Confederate troops. A diversionary attack that escalated into a charge on the whole line. When the Confederates launched an attack on Sherman Blue led by Patrick Cleburne from a mountain 500 feet above, tens of thousands of Union soldiers spontaneously advanced up the steep slopes to their front and tore through working guns at Missionary Ridge alignment. The stunning victory shifted the tide of battle and also established Chattanooga as a cornerstone to Union power in Tennessee, which allowed for future Major General William T.

Sherman then learned of the situation in Chattanooga and planned a risky operation at Brown's Ferry to reopen supply lines During the night of October 27,1863 Union forces launched a rarely successful nighttime raid on this Ferry, and freed it from Confederate control. This operation enabled the Union to open and maintain the \"Cracker Line,\" a critical supply route that thwarted Rosecrans' defeat, saved his army at Chattanooga.

This is a trail loop to access primitive campsites and is also a nice 2 mile hike to explore a less frequently traveled, but still fairly easy hike. As with all of the other trails in the park remember to bring appropriate footwear, something that can handle moisture and rocky terrain. Like the Meadowlands Trail the closest parking will be at the disc golf course.\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n\n  <div class=\"flex flex-col justify-center items-center mb-16 mt-16\">\n    <image src=\"/images/chattanooga_guides/outdoors/cloudland/trail-shot.jpg\" class=\"responsive-box pb-1\" alt=\"West Rim and Overlook Trail fork\">\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <em>On the trail in CCSP</em>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <section class=\"pb-3 text-xl2\" id=\"mtb-easy\">\n    <div>\n      <h2 class=\"text-5xl\">Easier MTB Rides<span class=\"color-pink ml-1\"><b>.</b></span></h2>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pb-8\">\n      The easier MTB rides below are from the 5 Points Recreation Area.

Each trail is designated as easy. Shale Flats is a total climb of 53 feet and Bankhead's climb is 73ft, unknown climb on this section of CCC but expect between 100-200 feet.

This time of darkness began with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a federal law that required all Native American nations to relocate outside their ancestral homelands in present-day Oklahoma. This policy caused a great deal of human misery, as entire communities were forcibly evicted from places where they had lived and worked for hundreds of years.\n    <br><br>\n    Many of the other tribes were subject to cruelty by American troops — and as one of the last bands, in 1838, they faced their terrifying journey that would take them over a thousand miles. Though on the way, that became one of the darkest chapters in American History known as Trail Of Tears which would be remembered and called forced migration. Cherokee people were subject to starvation, exposure to the elements of winter weather without food or supplies, and epidemics. Which led to the deaths of about 4,000 Cherokee — a sad reminder that this journey also played into wider patterns of destruction for communities already facing displacement.\n    <br><br>\n    Colonialism continued to shape the US long after declaring independence from Britain, as European settlers violently dispossessed its Indigenous inhabitants — including many of the Cherokee who passed through Chattanooga on a forced removal. The physical layout of the city is so connected with what took place on The Long Walk, and that symbolism offers both historical power as a remembrance. For those exploring the area, it is important to remember and reflect on just how cataclysmic an event in history this was for the Cherokee Nation and one that has so deeply affected what you will find today. Learning this history is critical to understanding a comprehensive picture of Chattanoogan past, and resilience in those who bore endure the tragic journey.\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pb-2 text-2xl\">\n    <div>\n      <h2><span class=\"color-pink\">1.</span>&nbsp&nbsp Ross's Landing</h2>\n    </div>\n    <br>\n    <div>\n    Ross's Landing is a historic site at 201 Riverfront Parkway in the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee named for Cherokee Chief John Ross.
