This paired with the <a href=\"https://gastateparks.org/sites/default/files/parks/pdf/trailmaps/CloudlandCanyon_TrailMap.pdf\">trail</a> map should get you there. This is a trail loop to access primitive campsites and is also a nice 2 mile hike to explore a less frequently traveled, but still fairly easy hike. As with all of the other trails in the park remember to bring appropriate footwear, something that can handle moisture and rocky terrain. Like the Meadowlands Trail the closest parking will be at the disc golf course.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"mb-12 mt-12 flex flex-col justify-center items-center\">\n      <OptimizedImage src=\"/images/chattanooga_guides/outdoors/cloudland/trail-shot.webp\" alt=\"West Rim and Overlook trails fork in Cloudland Canyon\" />\n      <div class=\"text-center mt-4 text-[20px] max-w-2xl text-gray-600\">\n        <em>On the trail in CCSP</em>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <section class=\"pb-3 text-xl\" id=\"mtb-easy\">\n      <div>\n        <h2 class=\"text-5xl\" style=\"font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;\">Easier MTB Rides<span class=\"color-pink ml-1\"><b>.</b></span></h2>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"pb-5\">\n        The easier MTB rides below are from the 5 Points Recreation Area.

CCC connects to many other trails in the 5 points network so you'll see a lot of forks, but just take CCC every time. The trail ends at Hinkie Road (RT 157).
