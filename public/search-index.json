This remarkable waterfall is not only one of the tallest and deepest underground waterfalls accessible to the public in the United States, but it also offers a unique adventure for visitors of all ages.\n\nDiscovered in 1928 by Leo Lambert, who named the falls after his wife Ruby, the site has since captivated the imaginations of millions. The journey to the falls begins with an elevator ride that plunges visitors over 260 feet below the surface, where the temperature is a constant, cool 60 degrees Fahrenheit, providing a welcome respite from the Southern heat.\n\nThe path to the waterfall winds through a series of caverns filled with rich geological wonders. Stalactites and stalagmites line the route, and dramatic rock formations create eerie shadows and shapes, illuminated by strategically placed lighting that enhances their natural beauty. The tour guides provide insights into the cave's geology, history, and the various formations, such as \"The Steak,\" \"The Totem Pole,\" and \"The Elephant's Foot,\" making each turn and discovery a learning opportunity.\n\nThe climax of the tour is the stunning view of Ruby Falls itself. Plunging 145 feet, the waterfall cascades down into a small pool, illuminated by a colorful light show that highlights the waterfall’s natural features and the surrounding rock faces. The sight is breathtaking and offers a surreal experience as the sound of the water echoes through the cavern.\n\nRuby Falls also offers various other attractions, including the Lookout Mountain Tower, which provides panoramic views of the Tennessee River Valley, and the ZIPstream aerial adventure, which adds a thrilling aerial perspective of the area's natural beauty.\n\nThe conservation efforts at Ruby Falls are notable. The site uses LED lighting to minimize environmental impact and operates with a focus on sustainability. These efforts ensure the preservation of the cave’s natural state, allowing visitors to enjoy its beauty for generations to come.\n\nVisiting Ruby Falls is a journey not just to a destination but through time and nature. It's an exploration that offers more than just a view, but an experience of the awe-inspiring power and serene beauty of nature, hidden deep beneath the Tennessee mountains. Whether you are an adventurer, a nature lover, or just looking for a unique experience, Ruby Falls provides an unforgettable adventure that resonates long after the journey ends.\n\n"},{"slug":"food-trucks","category":"blog","title":"Chattanooga Food Trucks: 6 of the Best Bites on Wheels","tags":["food"],"body":"\n<!-- California Smothered Burrito\nRolling J's Mobile Bistro\nTacos El Tote\nMama Yo's Soul Food\nChatter Box Cafe\nNonnis Empanadas -->\n\n<style>\n    @media (min-width: 768px) {\n        .responsive-box {\n            width: 28em !important;\n            height: 28em !important;\n        }\n    }\n</style>\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n    Chattanooga is a special place for food lovers with its diverse range of food trucks offering unique dishes so there's something for everyone.

It's an opportunity to unlock the secrets of effective building techniques while having fun constructing something that can support a person's weight.\n\nSarah brings decades of expertise in various construction fields, from wet plaster to carpentry and even plumbing, making her an invaluable guide in the art of making strong, beautiful structures.\n\nFor anyone interested in learning how basic design principles can lead to functional and aesthetic creations, this workshop is a chance to gain practical skills in a hands-on, collaborative environment.\n"},{"slug":"feast-and-litha-ritual","category":"blog","title":"Midsummer Feast and Litha Ritual","tags":["crabtree-farms","farm","outdoors"],"body":"\nAs the summer solstice brings the golden light of Litha, Crabtree Farms invites you and your family to celebrate the season.

Now, with her fifth solo effort Real Gone! which dropped on Ruf Records March 10th, 2023, Venable has come of age.  \n\nAt 23, Venable is already an important artist in the roots music world. Her name has grown in stature with each new album and high-energy gig. She’s an absolutely ripping guitar player with style and tone for days, a commanding singer, and a songwriter with the power to make blues music that speaks to contemporary fans. The new record, produced by Grammy winner Tom Hambridge (Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi), features guest appearances by Joe Bonamassa and living legend Buddy Guy.  \n\nVenable is that rare musician who can take her old-school influences like Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughan and create music that brings their spirits to today’s listeners where they live. Together with Isaac Pulido (drums) EJ Bedford (bass), she gives audiences an entertaining show packed with musical muscle and relatable songs about living, growing, and evolving. When asked where her songs emerge from, Ally replied “I try to write about what goes on in my life, or try to write about something I know others can relate to. We all go through things and it’s okay to have feelings about something going on in your life.”  \n\nThe first single from Real Gone! is “Texas Louisiana,” which is a crackling duet with the one-and-only Buddy Guy. Ally and Buddy are an absolute dream team together, intertwining their guitars and voices into one without either losing any identity or impact. The title track “Real Gone” is a straight-up, body-moving rocker that will also be a single. Venable shouts down the microphone like a star while her guitar snarls and sings.  \n\nOn the soulful ballad “Next Time I See You,” Ally downshifts her vocals and shows every dynamic degree of her impressive range. Her guitar work here is equally lyrical and emotive, displaying a gift for phrasing that few players ever attain. The grinding slow jam “Blues Is My Best Friend” lays out the ups and downs of the guitar lifestyle in no uncertain terms and features some of Venable’s most intense playing and singing on the entire set. Ally’s deep, cliche-free authenticity is the common thread running through every song on Real Gone!. She speaks her mind without hesitation or apology, turning each track into an honest statement of purpose.  \n\nIn 2022, Guitar World Magazine named Ally one of the Top 15 ‘Young Guns’ Making the Gibson Les Paul Cool Again and she also received the Road Warrior Award from the Independent Blues Music Awards. She performed as a featured artist on the Experience Hendrix Show in Austin, TX and appeared alongside Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Zack Wilde, Eric Johnson, Dweezil Zappa, and other luminaries.  \n\nWith 2019’s Texas Honey and 2021’s Heart of Fire, Venable found herself topping the Billboard charts. Early releases No Glass Shoes (2016) and Puppet Show (2018) created her fanbase, charted on radio, and won several East Texas Music Awards. Venable’s acclaimed performances on Ruf Records’ European Blues Caravan tour brought her international recognition. She has toured the U.S. with Buddy Guy and Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Canada with Colin James. \n\nThis year, Ally will be opening for Buddy Guy on his farewell tour, rocking Europe again on the Blues Caravan Tour, and doing her own headline shows domestically and abroad. She’s had a rapid rise to fame but gives off the vibe of someone who loves her life and is ok with it all.  \n\n....\n\nIn addition to hosting events, the Songbirds Foundation runs a variety of music focused initiatives for kids in Chattanooga.

Lee has been collecting stories for years, both on stage and off. \"I used to bartend,\" says the Nashville-based songwriter, \"which means I was also a cheap therapist for whomever happened to be sitting on the barstool. Whether they were there to celebrate or drink away their problems, I heard about whatever they were going through. It was my job to have that face-to-face interaction—that connection. Being a full-time musician isn't much different.\"\n\nWith critically-acclaimed albums like 2019's farmland, 2020's Honky-Tonk Hell, and 2022's The Hometown Kid, Lee created that connection by delivering his own stories to an ever-growing audience. His fourth record, Drink the River, takes a different approach. This time, Lee isn't offering listeners a peek into his internal world; he's holding up a mirror to reflect their own.\n\nStorytelling has been an anchor of Lee's music since the very beginning. Raised by Taiwanese parents in Nashville, TN, he left home during his teenage years and headed to Indiana, where he obtained college degrees in literature and journalism. Lee launched his career as a genre-bending musician after returning to Tennessee, quickly progressing from dive bar gigs to high-profile opening slots (including shows with Jason Isbell, Los Lobos, Molly Tuttle, and other artists who, like him, blurred the lines between roots-rock, country, and other forms of American folk music) to his own headlining shows. Throughout it all, he drew upon the narrative skills he'd sharpened as a student. If albums like Honky-Tonk Hell and The Hometown Kid often unfolded like autobiographical entries from his road journal, then Drink the River shows an even broader range of his storytelling abilities. Lee isn't just writing songs about himself; he's writing songs about all of us. And maybe, in doing so, he can bring us a little closer together\n\n....\n\nIn addition to hosting events, the Songbirds Foundation runs a variety of music focused initiatives for kids in Chattanooga.

The trio, now based in Richmond, captures the collective spirit of three Virginia natives: Teddy Chipouras, Mānoa Bell, and Sasha Landon. Often described as a distant cousin to The Avett Brothers and The Wood Brothers, Palmyra nods toward Appalachian and Midwestern Americana, with intricate arrangements that create the illusion of a full, larger-than-three ensemble. \n\nThe breakout folk trio has worked diligently to cement themselves as an unmistakable force in the Americana music landscape at large. Their forward momentum is propelled by their craftsmanship and dedication to an intimate performance experience; at the heart of the Palmyra is the evident love and regard that the three musicians share for each other and their craft.\n\n- - -\n\nHost of the roots music history podcast American Songcatcher, Nicholas Edward Williams is a multi-instrumentalist and storyteller who is dedicated to \"playing it forward\" by preserving the songs, stories, artists and styles that have shaped our country: Ragtime, Piedmont Blues, Early Country, Traditional Folk and Old-Time. Williams has spent the last 15 years touring three continents, performing all around the US, as well as the UK, Western Europe and Australia, blending the roots music spectrum in his own style. Under his previous project, Whetherman, Williams independently released eight revered records from 2007-2018. Under his own name, his critically acclaimed sophomore release from late 2021, Folk Songs For Old Times' Sake has been heralded by well-regarded figures of the roots community such as David Holt, Oliver Wood, Dom Flemons, and JP Harris.\n\n....\n\nIn addition to hosting events, the Songbirds Foundation runs a variety of music focused initiatives for kids in Chattanooga.

It's his own version of modern-day American roots music: a mix of roadhouse rock & roll, bluesy R&B, and country-fried funky-tonk, driven forward by groove, grease, and guitars. \n\nIt's also a sound that owes as much to the road — where Morrow spent most of the past decade on tour, supporting albums like Concrete & Mud and Gettin' By On Gettin' Down — as the various places he's called home. This is music for the fast lane. Music for empty highways. Music for people who, like Morrow, always seem to find themselves in transit. \n\n\"I feel like I'm searching for something,\" he says. \"I've been on some kind of journey. Maybe I don't know what I'm looking for, exactly, but I'm keeping my eyes open.\" \n\nOn The Ride Here marks the latest leg of that journey. Morrow takes us along for the ride, singing in a laidback Texas drawl about highway haunts (\"Thunderbird Motel\"), peyote trips in the Mojave Desert (\"Searching For Paradise\"), and the glamor and grind of the open road (\"Hired Gun\"). On The Ride Here offers more than roadside ephemera and travelogue tales, though. Morrow isn't just focused on the drive these days; he's interested in the destination, too, and a number of these songs deal with the hard lessons and new perspectives that come with rest, reflection, and time spent at home. \n\nMorrow's first home was in Houston, Texas, where he grew up developing not only an appreciation for punk, hip-hop, and ZZ Top, but also an appetite for the vices that would land him in rehab while still a teenager. He eventually found sobriety in Los Angeles and chose to stay there, trading his Texas roots for the California coast. Living far away from his birthplace gave Morrow a new appreciation for the country music he'd once ignored as a Texan. He began filtering those country sounds into his own music, mashing them together with the southern boogie of Little Feat, the electric blues of Freddie King, the Tex-Mex of Los Lobos, and the desert rock of Queens Of The Stone Age. Separately, those influences might have sounded like strange bedfellows. Together, though, they formed the bedrock of Sam Morrow's rootsy rock & roll. \n\nChampioned by outlets like NPR and Rolling Stone, Morrow's first four albums turned him into one of the West Coast's biggest Americana exports. The appeal wasn't just the swaggering, swampy music itself; it was also the sharp storytelling and unfiltered insights of a songwriter who wasn't afraid to shine a light on the skeletons in his closet. Balancing honesty with self-deprecating humor, Morrow became a working-class hero for those struggling to follow the straight and narrow. On The Ride Here finds him in that same position. He measures the distance between the sins of his youth and the challenges of his present with \"Medicine Man,\" a stomping, riff-driven rocker with a slide guitar solo worthy of Joe Walsh. \"Searching For Paradise\" finds him in Hunter S. Thompson mode, recounting a hallucinogenic trip in the California desert over a backdrop of greasy, East L.A. country-funk. The loose, laidback \"On My Way\" finds him asking a lover for patience, promising her that his best days are ahead. A similar message anchors \"Straight and Narrow,\" which trades the fiery fretwork of the album's louder moments — played by Morrow and guest guitarist Eli Wulfmeier— for the cooling calm of Hammond B3 organ. \"I was tripped by sin; I walked the line and I fell halfway in,\" Morrow sings before laying out his credentials as a changed man, promising that \"I'm a new man with a new suit.\" \n\nOn The Ride Here was produced in Southern California by longtime collaborator Eric Corne, with an all-star roster of West Coast musicians — including bassist Ted Russell Kamp, keyboardist Sasha Smith, and drummers Matt Tecu and Butch Norton — adding primal punch and roughhewn polish to the 11 songs. Morrow rewrote several tunes after the initial tracking sessions were complete, looking to deliver the tightest, tautest album of his career. The result is a forward-thinking record that encapsulates his sound better than any album before it, serving as the final piece of a musical trilogy that began with the country-inspired Concrete & Mud and the rock-influenced Gettin' By On Gettin' Down. \n\n\"When I was first getting sober, somebody told me that I need to wake up early in the morning and tell myself I don't know shit, because that's the only way I'm gonna learn something new that day,\" Morrow says. \"I think it's a simplified way of just taking your ego out of the situation. I still do that to this day. I try to remain mindful and present. I try to learn something I didn't know before. And with this album, I think I've learned what my sound is. I've learned to truly sound like myself.\" \n\n....\n\nIn addition to hosting events, the Songbirds Foundation runs a variety of music focused initiatives for kids in Chattanooga.

Married Alone is Sweeney’s finest work yet, bringing together confessional songwriting, image-rich narratives and no shortage of sonic surprises for a loosely conceptual album about loss and healing. \n\nMarried Alone began as most of Sweeney’s projects do: with a visit to her deep vault of unreleased songs. Since debuting with Heartbreaker’s Hall of Fame in 2006, Sweeney has been a prolific writer, writing whatever is on her heart rather than with a particular project in mind. That habit afforded her a rich well of material for Married Alone, some of which is over a decade old. \n\nThe full potential of the album really revealed itself, though, when a friend sent Sweeney a demo of what would become its title track, “Married Alone.” Though she wasn’t a co-writer on the track, Sweeney felt her own story reflected in its lyrics. The song, which features a particularly emotional guest vocal from living country legend Vince Gill, charts the painful moments sometimes experienced in marriages that have run their course.  \n\n“There may be rings on our fingers, but we’re married alone,” she and Gill sing, over weeping pedal steel and reverbed guitar. \n\n“My jaw hit the floor when I heard that song, because I had just gone through my second divorce, which is also cliche of a country singer,” Sweeney says, with a laugh. “I was still pretty raw about my divorce, but also very candid and trying to find levity in the situation. You have to be able to laugh at yourself at some point and not let it just totally get you down.” \n\nIn addition to releasing Married Alone, Sweeney is marking a new chapter in her professional life with a brand-new team by her side, most of whom are women. While it wasn’t a conscious choice, Sweeney says, she feels like she’s surrounded by the right group of people, who just happen to be “badass women.” \n\nSweeney is not the kind of artist you come across then forget. With Married Alone, she further cements her status as one of country music’s finest storytellers. \n\n....\n\nIn addition to hosting events, the Songbirds Foundation runs a variety of music focused initiatives for kids in Chattanooga.
