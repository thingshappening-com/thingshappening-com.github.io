How The Fuck Does This Thing Even Work? When would I need to change each for handling?
- [...page].astro at src/pages/[...page].astro
This is for pagination

- BlogPost.astro
post rendering

- BlogPostLayout.astro / 
rendered inside of each .astro file for an [eventTitle]. passes props to blogpost.astro

- index.astro
This is the homepage. It functions basically the same way as [...page].astro
They each render Card components. This one also renders it form guides in addition to events

- getStaticPaths
In Astro, getStaticPaths is used to generate a list of dynamic routes at build time, telling Astro
which pages to pre-render. When passed { paginate }, you can split large datasets into paginated chunks for 
creating multi-page lists like blog indexes or event listings.
You might need to modify getStaticPaths when:
Your data source changes — e.g. switching from local .mdx files to a CMS or API, so the way you gather routes needs to be updated.
Your URL structure changes — like adding date-based paths (/events/2025/07/04) instead of just slugs.
You want to filter or sort content — for example, only include future events, or order blog posts by publish date.
You're adding pagination — or changing how many items appear per page (paginate(data, { pageSize: 10 })).
You’re localizing content — and need to generate paths for each language (/en/post-title, /es/post-title, etc.).
Basically, any time your route logic or content structure evolves, getStaticPaths needs to reflect that.


Types of events and notes on how they work:
- Multiple events same day (woodcraft)
- 

Questions:
- How is a URL created? 




Other (older) Documentation:
- Define a slot - The <slot /> element is a placeholder for external HTML content, allowing you to inject (or “slot”) child elements from other files into your component template. By default, all child elements passed to a component will be rendered in its <slot />. BlogPostLayout renders a <slot> within <BlogPost>, which contains the contents from the markdown
- Routing for multiple cities - all routing for content is by directories underneath pages - ex Pages -> Chattanooga -> Events, Attractions. I think Ill need to update the tagging functionality to get Astro.glob for multiple .md paths if it doesn’t get them all properly from the /pages top level
- Tags
    - Defined in markdown
    - Rendered as links in post.tags.map((t) => <a href={`/tag/${t}`} class="transition-all duration-75 h-fit inline pr-2">{`#${t}`}</a>)
    - Because the link is to a /tag path it will look for that under /pages
    - [tag].md allows it to be a dynamic route /tag/${t}
- Multiple dates
    - eventDates key in .md files
    - In the src/pages/chattanooga/events/index.astro added logic to iterate over the events, create a new object from the frontmatter and adds each date as a new post that includes a pubDate of the given date
- How does a blog post get rendered
- Dynamic routes explained (as well as I can)
    - Need to define [paramvalue].astro - paramvalue also needs to be exported from getStaticPaths in the form of [
    -   { params: { date: '2024-05-09' } },
    -   { params: { date: '2024-05-10' } },
    -   { params: { date: '2024-05-11' } }
    - ]
    - Where date is equal to paramvalue
