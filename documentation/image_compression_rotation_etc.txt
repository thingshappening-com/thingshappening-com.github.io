brew packages I installed:
brew install webp - for webp conversions
brew list imagemagick - sometimes the conversion rotated the image and figma / preview dont support edits to webp

commands:
note you can change quality, 80 is high I usually did 60 for a smaller image
```
cwebp -q 50 jpg_file_path -o webp_file_path
```

rotate image
```
magick woodshop1.webp -rotate 90 woodshop1.webp
```

this didnt seem super useful after using cwebp 50, but supposedly does more compression
```
magick mogrify -format webp -quality 60 /path/to/images/*.webp
```
