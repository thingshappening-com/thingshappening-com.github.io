This tragic event occurred as part of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a federal law that sought to forcibly relocate Native American tribes from their homelands in the southeastern United States to designated territories west of the Mississippi River, in what is now Oklahoma. The removal process was harsh and devastating, leading to the suffering and deaths of thousands of Native Americans.\n    <br><br>\n    <div>\n    In 1838, the Cherokee were among the last to be forcibly removed from their lands. This grueling journey, covering over 1,000 miles, was marked by extreme hardship, disease, and death, with an estimated 4,000 Cherokee lives lost along the way. Chattanooga served as a significant departure point for many of these groups, making it a crucial location in the history of the Trail of Tears.\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pb-2 text-2xl\">\n    <div>\n      <h2><span class=\"color-pink\">1.</span>&nbsp&nbsp Ross's Landing</h2>\n    </div>\n    <br>\n    <div>\n    Ross's Landing, located at 201 Riverfront Parkway in Chattanooga, TN, is a historically significant site named after Cherokee Chief John Ross.

In 1838, Ross's Landing became a crucial departure point for the Cherokee during their forced removal known as the Trail of Tears.
