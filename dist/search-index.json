Each trail is designated as easy. Shale Flats is a total climb of 53 feet and Bankhead's climb is 73ft, unknown climb on this section of CCC but expect between 100-200 feet.

It's recommended not to take your dog, as there are over 600 grated metal stairs that can be painful on their paws. The difficulty of this hiking trail is rewarded by the waterfalls, along this path is both the Hemlock and Cherokee falls. The waterflow varies, but will be best after a rainstorm.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>  \n    <div>\n      <div class=\"pb-3\">\n      <div class=\"text-3xl\"><span class=\"color-pink mr-2\"><b>3.</b></span>Sitton's Gulch Trail</div>\n        <div><b>Distance:</b> 6 miles</div>\n        <div>\n          <b>\n            <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sitton's+Gulch+Trailhead/@34.8598776,-85.4847427,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8860492ec67befcb:0x9a3068fca515b87b!8m2!3d34.8598776!4d-85.4847427!16s%2Fg%2F11bzsf0zbx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">\n              Directions\n            </a>\n          </b>\n        </div>      \n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          This is a 6 mile out and back trail.
