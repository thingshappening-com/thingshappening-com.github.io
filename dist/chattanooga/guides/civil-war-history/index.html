    Every hill, ridge and river crossing bears testimony to the titanic struggle between the two great armies during one of the deadliest campaigns of The War. It is the sacrifices, strategies and sheer determination that made up two opposing armies fighting for control of such a vital gateway to what came to define America forever.Quite simply it helped win the war.
    <br><br>
    From the imposing ridgeline of Missionary Ridge, where Union forces overcame a surprising and dramatic Confederate assault, to the contemplative Tower at Orchard Knob (where General Ulysses S. Grant planned his campaign) each site is an evocative reminder of those fateful days around Chattanooga well more than 150 years ago. The Battle of Brown's Ferry, although clouded by more famous battles that occurred during the same time frame is very important as it marked a key point in breaking the Confederate siege on Chattanooga and establishing control over "Wauhatchie", aka the all-important ‘Cracker Line’, which would keep vital supplies flowing to sustain clear victory for Federal forces here through this part of 1863.
    <br><br>
    In this guide, you'll be offered a guided walking tour of these historic places — not just where they are and what to expect when you get there, but the stories contained within them as well. Wether or not you are walking the same ground where generals planned their next move, or standing where ordinary soldiers performed extraordinary feats of arms these places bring to life the Civil War in almost a way only experienced by those who have had this experience. This is a must-see tour for any student of the Civil War, allowing one to explore America as it lived during and just after this flashpoint conflict.

    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      The Battle of Chickamauga was fought in September 1863, and led to one of the biggest Confederate victories but also contributed to Union success during its Chattanooga Campaign. The park was created in 1890 to give visitors a chance to understand this immersive Civil War experience and walk the battlefields, view memorials, as well as see what strategies were used at that time by soldiers who fight up there.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>

      On 24 November, Union forces under Major General Joseph Hooker made a movement up Lookout Mountain and dislodged Confederate troops who were in entrenched positions there. Lifted the Confederate siege of Chattanooga and opened up a chance for Union victory at Missionary Ridge on Nov. It was a minor skirmish in the war, but that tiny battle had wide-ranging ramifications and Point Park is there to remind us of such an important moment.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      The park was founded in 1895, and it gives visitors the opportunity to explore this historic area. The New York Peace Memorial, a huge monument in the park, within depicts symbolizes reconciliation between North and South with Union hand Confederate soldiers appearing to be shaking hands. At 85 feet tall, this memorial is one of the most dominant in a park full of them.

      Point Park is typically less crowded than many Chattanooga attractions, so it's a good place to visit if you enjoy solitude. The park is large and there are plenty of trails, so you always have space to think about the history or just look around at nature. Heritage Transport Museum — This museum is open from 10 AM to 7 PM, but the best timings are early morning or late evening when light will be better and it's less hot.

The observatory, named after Adolph S. Ochs who was the publisher of The New York Times and played a pivotal role in preserving Lookout Mountain as all but needed local land for parkland purposes (he also helped secure funding from Rockefeller), is a great spot to get your photography fix or take it easy on some absolutely stunning views!

    <br>
    <div>
      The Moccasin Bend National Archeological District -located in Chattanooga, Tennessee- has a historic significance that can be traced back to for at least the Civil War. Rising 160 feet above the bend is Moccasin Bend, long famous for its archaeological significance; evidence of human society on this promontory has been found dating back to over twelve millenniums ago exactly at a time when men would soon gather with tanks and planes across the world in Europe — but also as far East were Russia and Japan fought their war.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      Drawing on a Tribune of the People inspector making his way to Chattanooga,National Park ServiceExpress/Getty ImagesDuring the war, Moccasin Bend — and its location along the Tennessee River — proved important for Union forces. This natural positioning was a great benefit for the Union army, which would be able to shell Lookout Mountain via artillery during "The Battle Above The Clouds" on November 24th. Several weeks later, Union forces including Wilder's men captured Chattanooga from the Confederates in a campaign that was crucial to driving the Rebel army back south and out of Tennessee due its important position at railroads and supply lines.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      But in an age before highways and railroads, the river offered a vital route for carrying supplies to soldiers fighting on other parts of the war's battlegrounds. Claiming this area guided Sherman down a path towards one of his biggest victories — leading to the Atlanta Campaign and forward onto perhaps Sherman's greatest legacy, The March to the Sea.
    </div>
    <div>
      Today Moccasin Bend is a component of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, these lands are protected for both their archaeologically significant past as well as Civil War history. A system of trails allows visitors to move through the area, offering views of the Tennessee River and Lookout Mountain that connect not only historically but physically with what occurred here. The trails are well-signed interpretive and informational signs add context to all the views.

    <br>
    <div>
      November 22, 1863 The Battle of Missionary Ridge was the climax to an offensive operation by Union forces against the fortified positions held by a Confederate force under Gen. After taking success at Lookout Mountain and Orchard Knob, the Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant attacked the fortified positions well entrenched on ridges held in numbers for great effect of Confederate troops. A diversionary attack that escalated into a charge on the whole line. When the Confederates launched an attack on Sherman Blue led by Patrick Cleburne from a mountain 500 feet above, tens of thousands of Union soldiers spontaneously advanced up the steep slopes to their front and tore through working guns at Missionary Ridge alignment. The stunning victory shifted the tide of battle and also established Chattanooga as a cornerstone to Union power in Tennessee, which allowed for future Major General William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign later that year.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      Today, Missionary Ridge is a quiet residential community but it still remembers the past with numerous markers, monuments and reservations denoting the battle. The ridge can be visited by driving Missionary Ridge Road which generally runs the crest of the ridge and would give visitors access to sites such as Bragg Reservation (which is located about a mile beyond where I stood watching you on Goodwin Avenue) or perhaps DeLong Reservation. From these locations you can see for miles and get an idea of the significance the ridge held to troops.

The Union army in Chattanooga, Tennessee was trapped and under siege by Confederate forces commanded by General Braxton Bragg. If they ran out of food, the Union soldiers were going to be in serious trouble without supply lines. Union generals including Ulysses S. Grant, George Thomas and William T. Sherman then learned of the situation in Chattanooga and planned a risky operation at Brown's Ferry to reopen supply lines During the night of October 27,1863 Union forces launched a rarely successful nighttime raid on this Ferry, and freed it from Confederate control. This operation enabled the Union to open and maintain the "Cracker Line," a critical supply route that thwarted Rosecrans' defeat, saved his army at Chattanooga. It was a masterstroke of military strategy and played an important role in the eventual Union triumph during this campaign.
    </div>
    <br>

    An often ignored historic footprint, Brown's Ferry is a meandering expanse for many seeking to reflect upon the significance of this time in American history. The road and ferry crossing are accessible from the Lookout Valley end of Chattanooga, Tenn., with no regular hours or entrance fees -- so you're free to visit anytime.

The straight line crosses over Orchard Knob, a small hill in Chattanooga that bears tremendous historical significance from the Civil War. This site was just as important during the Chattanooga Campaign of 1863, although it's not nearly as spectacular to view. During the offensive, Union General James Longstreet used Surgeons Hill as a vital observation point from which he could direct his troops and see farther ahead than any Confederates.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
The following day, November 23 rd, General Ulysses S. Grant commanded Union troops to attack Orchard Knob and captured it from Confederate fighters. Moreover, this position also granted the Union commanders a full perspective of their environment which was perfect for devising/planning the later attacks on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain. Here Grant and his generals directed the assaults that would end a Confederate siege on Chattanooga by turning it into one of the most important Union bases, which indeed marked an pivotal point in Civil War.
