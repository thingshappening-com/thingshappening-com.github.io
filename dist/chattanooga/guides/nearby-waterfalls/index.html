    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      Summary: The hike to Foster Falls is a 1.6-mile loop trail that the Tennessee State Parks rates as "moderate," because it includes several steep sections over rocky terrain. Including the waterfall top and base, you can get a bird's eye view of it from this trail. To travel to the base of this cascade, park visitors must first cross a suspension bridge that bridges Fiery Gizzard Creek and ends at Foster Falls Base, where hikers can enjoy mild temperatures emanating from rushing water. Dogs are allowed on this trail but need to be leashed up

    <br>
    <div>
      Foster Falls is open year-round, but the best time to go is in the spring or autumn when temperatures are good and leaves are popping. Since summers are very busy and the island can be crowded – particularly on weekends — it is best to get there early in the morning or during week days.

      Ozone Falls is located atop the eastern edge of the Crab Orchard Mountains, surrounded by large tilted sandstone faces. Wind and water erosion has created a semicircular cavity that acts as a natural framework for the falls over these eons. Upland vegetation surrounding it is made up of oaks, Virginia pine, eastern hemlock, white pines, magnolia, yellow birch, tulip poplar, red oak, sugar maple, and other flowering plants.

      The 0.3-mile Out and Back Trail cuts steeply down into the gorge to reach Ozone Falls, making for a strenuous return scramble out of the half-mile hike. It is a slightly challenging trail with big rocks and rocky terrain. In route, visitors are treated to expansive vistas and can explore Gambler's Den rock house.
      <br><br>
      <div>The pool beneath Ozone Falls is okay to swim in. Downstream, along the cliffs a bit, the water runs fast and hard—this must be immediately after it goes over the waterfall. Especially with kids, visitors should be careful.</div>

      The moderate climate and wild plant life make Ozone Falls particularly lovely in the spring and fall. Summer afternoons can be full with park traffic, so plan for an earlier or later visit if you want fewer people there.

    <h2><span class="color-pink">11.</span>  Twin Falls</h2>
    <div>
      Twin Falls: Twin Falls, located inside Rock Island State Park at 82 Beach Road, Rock Island TN 38581 is an impressive eighty-foot waterfall that plunges through the bluffs of a limestone gorge. The falls were created accidentally when the Caney Fork River was dammed by the Great Falls Dam, causing water from the Collins River to flow underground and escape behind gorge walls.

    <br>
    <div>
      Rugged limestone and sandstone cliffs typical of the Cumberland Plateau surround the area. The place is abounding with natural biodiversity hence this becomes lush and green with plants around the falls.
