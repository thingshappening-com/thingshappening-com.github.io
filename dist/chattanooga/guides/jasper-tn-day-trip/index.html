            <div class="mb-0p5"><b>About:</b> Lookout Valley Coffee Shop is a neighborhood-kinda-place where you can have the coziest beginning to your day. However, as there is only a scarce amount of information available on the website concerning its whereabouts and operational hours hence it would be wise to check where exactly this panda cafe in Tokyo (shinjuku) really is before making your way down. And if the place isn´t open, you can get a fast breakfast option for early hours in some diners or even the usual fast-food places. Chances are, the ambiance is informal and homey (in that small-town coffeehouse sort of way).</div>
            <div class="mb-0p5"><b>Crowds:</b> It is likely that being a lesser-known shop, the crowds will be small. Perfect for a quiet start.</div>
