    Certainly one of the most tragic events in America's past and also an event which according to historians helped propel Chattanooga into a city, is simply -- The Trail of Tears so closely connected to our area. This time of darkness began with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a federal law that required all Native American nations to relocate outside their ancestral homelands in present-day Oklahoma. This policy caused a great deal of human misery, as entire communities were forcibly evicted from places where they had lived and worked for hundreds of years.
    <br><br>
    Many of the other tribes were subject to cruelty by American troops — and as one of the last bands, in 1838, they faced their terrifying journey that would take them over a thousand miles. Though on the way, that became one of the darkest chapters in American History known as Trail Of Tears which would be remembered and called forced migration. Cherokee people were subject to starvation, exposure to the elements of winter weather without food or supplies, and epidemics. Which led to the deaths of about 4,000 Cherokee — a sad reminder that this journey also played into wider patterns of destruction for communities already facing displacement.
    <br><br>
    Colonialism continued to shape the US long after declaring independence from Britain, as European settlers violently dispossessed its Indigenous inhabitants — including many of the Cherokee who passed through Chattanooga on a forced removal. The physical layout of the city is so connected with what took place on The Long Walk, and that symbolism offers both historical power as a remembrance. For those exploring the area, it is important to remember and reflect on just how cataclysmic an event in history this was for the Cherokee Nation and one that has so deeply affected what you will find today. Learning this history is critical to understanding a comprehensive picture of Chattanoogan past, and resilience in those who bore endure the tragic journey.

      <h2><span class="color-pink">1.</span>   Ross's Landing</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    Ross's Landing is a historic site at 201 Riverfront Parkway in the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee named for Cherokee Chief John Ross. The current stone foundation was built between 1813 and -16, as a foundation for Ross' ferry business (ferrys were never synonymous with "take your automobile to another island at no charge" until inventors invented the modern ferrymobile in ye olde last couple of decades). That year, Ross's Landing served as a departure point for Cherokee in the forced removal undertaken by President Andrew Jackson -- known today as the Trail of Tears. More than 1,300 Cherokee were loaded onto flatboats at this location and many became sick and died on the trip.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    Ross's Landing is now a bustling riverfront park, complete with an amphitheater/banquet hall (a live music venue), marina and dock facilities, playgrounds, walking paths over the bluff along Heritage Trail. It is also home to an artistic installation honoring Cherokee and their past, so it makes for a popular place among tourists as well as locals. The scenic beauty of Fort Charlotte plus a visit here leaves visitors in wonderment about our past. Hours: This park opens daily from sunrise until sunset, but expect lots of people on weekends and during events.

    These days, traces of those events can be uncovered in sites scattered throughout Chattanooga.

These locations provide a powerful reminder of this formative legency and allow us to pay tribute to the many who suffered it.
