  </div>
  <div class="text-2xl">
    The Trail of Tears represents one of the darkest periods in American history, particularly for the Cherokee Nation, and has deep ties to the Chattanooga area. This tragic event occurred as part of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a federal law that sought to forcibly relocate Native American tribes from their homelands in the southeastern United States to designated territories west of the Mississippi River, in what is now Oklahoma. The removal process was harsh and devastating, leading to the suffering and deaths of thousands of Native Americans.
    <br><br>
    <div>
    In 1838, the Cherokee were among the last to be forcibly removed from their lands. This grueling journey, covering over 1,000 miles, was marked by extreme hardship, disease, and death, with an estimated 4,000 Cherokee lives lost along the way. Chattanooga served as a significant departure point for many of these groups, making it a crucial location in the history of the Trail of Tears.

In 1838, Ross's Landing became a crucial departure point for the Cherokee during their forced removal known as the Trail of Tears. Over 1,300 Cherokee were forced onto flatboats from this site, with many suffering and perishing during the journey.
