    Chattanooga's waterfront dining area is a vibrant element of its food scene with restaurants that run the gamut from quick and casual to sit-down fine dining. Whether you seek a casual meal with friends, family fun on the water or an intimate evening featuring stunning views of the river valley, Chattanooga's waterfront restaurants offer environments for all occasions. Featuring a variety of dining options, area restaurants include River Drifters with its laid-back rustic atmosphere and family-friendly comfort food in close proximity to the home site as well the more upscale gourmet creations paired an eye-catching backdrop of sweeping views along The Upper Bank overlooking Tennessee River.
    <br><br>
    Every restaurant has a unique experience that is enhanced by the beauty of natureethe surrounding city. One particularly unusual venue is the Southern Belle Riverboat, which serves diners and sightseers with scenic river cruises. Eating can also be something that is an experience all on its own, and as you sit down to dine whilst floating along the Tennessee River, it will become very apparent. To Chattanoogans, dining on the waterfront is more than just food—it's about creating moments that combine our gorgeous vistas with a riverfront experience to remember.

      The menu at the pasta bar is all about big, warm hugs. The popular selection seem to be their bison burger and fish tacos. Unique options are the Redneck Egg Rolls and Pimento Cheese Crostini. Best known for quality ingredients and massive portions of the food.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      River Drifters can get packed during dinner and weekends so it's best to come early to get a good seat. It's a buzzy place so ideal for both eating on the run and settling in to eat a full meal.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      As the temperature rises and more are looking for ways to get out of the house, River Drifters is offering kayak rentals (and soon paddleboard) as a way to pair with your meal.

    Pick up hours are Thursday through Sunday from 8:00 a.m. to 9 :00 p.m. It can be very crowded, especially in the summer months, so hitting up this restaurant during non-peak hours will likely make for a much more enjoyable experience.

  <br>
  <div>
Just upriver from Chattanooga, Steve's Landing offers casual waterfront dining with beautiful views of Lake Chickamauga. We are known to have a friendly vibe and diverse menu but do we operate in Hamilton?

  <br>
  <div>
    The Upper Bank is known for their fine dining experience and offers artwork that follows the same basic principle of using local products whenever possible to create a sophisticated menu. They have a large open dining area inside, but I much prefer the river view from their outdoor seating.
