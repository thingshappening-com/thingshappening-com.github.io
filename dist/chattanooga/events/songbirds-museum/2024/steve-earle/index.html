For every $100 raised, we’ll be able to buy a kid a guitar and provide them with 10 weeks of free lessons and music therapy. Your contribution allows us to share the joy of music with thousands of kids who would otherwise be without a music education..</p>

Helping to address a decline in public school music funding, supporting Cognitive Behavioral Music Therapy initiatives. They also bring student groups in to learn about the technical side of music with a focus on the STEAM behind components like guitars, pedals, and amps.
